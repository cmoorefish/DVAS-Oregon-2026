# 🔭 Strategic Vision: DVAS 2026 & Beyond

## 🎯 The Mission
To transform Oregon’s electoral landscape from a system of **blind trust** to one of **mathematical certainty**. We envision a future where every citizen’s privacy is a constitutional guarantee and every candidate’s accountability is an undeniable proof.

## 🏛️ Societal Outcomes

### 1. Restoration of the "Shared Reality"
By providing a "single source of truth" through Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), we eliminate the information gaps that fuel partisan polarization. Society regains a common ground where debates focus on a candidate's **ideas**, not their **funding sources**.

### 2. Radical Privacy for the Silent Majority
We envision an Oregon where citizens can participate in democracy without fear of social or professional retaliation. DVAS allows for "Selective Disclosure"—proving you are a legal, local resident of District 52 without exposing your specific name or address to public, searchable databases.

### 3. The End of Audit Fatigue
Current elections are reactive—fraud is found months after the fact. The DVAS vision is **proactive**; it prevents non-eligible data from entering the system at the source. This shifts millions in taxpayer funds away from manual audits and legal challenges back into community infrastructure.

### 4. The "Oregon Model" as a Global Standard
Success in the 2026 Sandy Pilot serves as a blueprint. We aim to prove that Oregon can be the national exporter of election trust, leading the way for secure digital town halls, verified local petitions, and high-integrity civic engagement.
