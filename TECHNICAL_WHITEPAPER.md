# 📄 Technical Whitepaper: The DVAS Zero-Knowledge Architecture
**Version:** 1.0 (2026 Pilot Edition)  
**Subject:** Cryptographic Verification of Voter Eligibility and Citizenship

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The Digital Verification and Auditing System (DVAS) addresses the "Trust Gap" in modern campaign finance. By utilizing **Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs)**, DVAS allows a donor to prove three critical legal facts to an auditor without exposing their private identity:
1. They are a **Natural Person** (not a shell LLC).
2. They are a **U.S. Citizen**.
3. They are a **Registered Voter** in the relevant jurisdiction.

## 2. The Logic: "The Magic Envelope"
To explain ZKP to non-technical stakeholders, we use the "Magic Envelope" analogy:
* **The Prover (Donor):** Puts their ID card inside a special envelope.
* **The Envelope:** Has a window that only shows a "Green Checkmark" if the ID is valid and from Oregon. It hides the name and address.
* **The Verifier (Auditor):** Sees the checkmark and the unique digital seal. They know the ID is real, but they never see the ID itself.

## 3. Prevention of Foreign Interference
DVAS eliminates the "Shell Company Loophole" by requiring a **Hardware-Backed Attestation**.
* **The Problem:** Post-Citizens United, foreign actors can form a U.S. LLC to donate.
* **The DVAS Solution:** A proof can only be generated by a device that has successfully "shaken hands" with an official government database (like the DMV or State Election API). Since an LLC does not have a "Digital Citizenship Key," it cannot generate the proof required to clear the DVAS firewall.

## 4. Immutable Audit Ledger
Once a proof is verified, it is written to a **Public Ledger**. 
* **Public View:** "Verification #8829: Valid Oregon Citizen - $250.00"
* **Auditor View:** Can verify the math of #8829 to ensure no double-counting or "ghost donors" occurred.
